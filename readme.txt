Music Playing Program for Milonga

New files can be added to the playlist via drag and drop.

Features:

Playback controls: Start, stop, pause, and move to the next track with a smooth fade-out.
Track management: Rearrange selected tracks.
Automatic silence detection: Identifies silence at the beginning and end of tracks.
Volume normalization: Ensures consistent playback volume.
Track color coding by genre:

Black: Tango or other genres.
Green: Vals.
Red: Cortina.
Yellow: Milonga.

Playlist export: Allows exporting the playlist.
Low-pass filter: Adjustable filter frequency for individual tracks by adding a comment, e.g., H:4000, to apply a 4 kHz low-pass filter. This feature is especially useful for playing old, low-quality recordings.
The program is available for Windows and MacOS.

I am a Tango DJ and Tango dancer. I created this program to meet my own needs.

Best regards,
